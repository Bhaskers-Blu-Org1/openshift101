# OpenShift 101

## Learn the Basics of Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud

A recent [study](https://github.com/svennam92/openshift101/tree/ab7f1406831de9aa1a60da349dd5bff8d11f7e13/workshop/study/README.md) by McKinsey & Company reveals that only 20 percent of enterprise applications have moved to the cloud. We believe that a hybrid cloud approach, built on open source and a vibrant open ecosystem, is the best way to move the remaining 80 percent.

Red Hat OpenShift represents a common platform, based on the industry-standard Kubernetes, that allows you to build on premises, on the IBM Cloud, or on any other leading cloud platform. You want freedom of choice; Red Hat OpenShift offers exactly that.
