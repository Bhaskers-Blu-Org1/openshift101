# Welcome

## This will be an overview of OpenShift on the IBM Cloud. Learn how to build, deploy, and secure cloud native applications on the world's leading open container platform

A recent [study][study] by McKinsey & Company reveals that only 20 percent of enterprise applications have moved to the cloud. We believe that a hybrid cloud approach, built on open source and a vibrant open ecosystem, is the best way to move the remaining 80 percent.

Red Hat OpenShift represents a common platform, based on the industry-standard Kubernetes, that allows you to build on premises, on the IBM Cloud, or on any other leading cloud platform. You want freedom of choice; Red Hat OpenShift offers exactly that.

In this lab we'll cover using the OpenShift platform on the IBM Cloud and the common developer loop around cloud native applications including:

- Kubernetes Basics
- Using OpenShift
- Deploying an application
- Scaling the application
- Reading logs and monitoring the appliction
- Rolling out v2 of the application
- Security and Role Based Access control in OpenShift and Kubernetes
- Runtime Security for containers

- Date: TBD
- Time: TBD
- Location: TBD
