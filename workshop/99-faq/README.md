## So what is OpenShift

To quote Wikipedia:

> OpenShift is a family of containerization software developed by Red Hat. Its flagship product is the OpenShift Container Platformâ€”an on-premises platform as a service built around Docker containers orchestrated and managed by Kubernetes on a foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
> The Openshift UI has various functionalities, allowing one to monitor the container resources, container health, the nodes the containers reside on, IP addresses of the nodes, etc. The key store can be accessed via the Secrets in Openshift. The OC CLI command line tool also offers similar functionalities.

But the stort of it? It's a abstraction layer **ON TOP** of Kubernetes. It's a way to empower Developers to deploy code and not worry about a lot of the underlying ecosystem. This workshop should show you the happy path to take advantage of most of the best parts of OpenShift and what it can offer.

## Log in to IBM Cloud

If you have created an IBM Cloud account before as Pay-as-You-Go account you might be needing to create a new account. Creating account using Gmail, Yahoo, or Outlook will work. If you have a corporate account with IBM already, it's safer to use a personal due to the IAM rules we'll use with our **Grant Cluster** application.

## I can't create a new account

Ask for whitelisting, or use your own smart phone with data plan (do not use local WiFi).

## I don't see the Web Console of OpenShift

Try restarting the VPN pod with the following command (log in to the environement using CLI token):

```bash
kubectl delete pod -l app=vpn -n kube-system --wait=false
```

## I see an error while deploying my image to an internal container registry

Try restarting the VPN with the following command:

```bash
kubectl delete pod -l app=vpn -n kube-system --wait=false
```

If that doesn't work please rebuild a cluster, or ask to get a new cluster.

In this section you will discover where you can find materials to learn more about Red Hat OpenShift, and use free of charge environment on your local machine with Minishift labs.

## Minishift setup and Minishift 101 lab

The following section describes how to install Minishift and the required dependencies.

These are the basic steps for setting up Minishift on your personal system:

- [Configure the virtualization environment](https://github.com/IBM/minishift101/blob/master/workshop/#configure-the-virtualization-environment)
- [Download and install Minishift](https://github.com/IBM/minishift101/blob/master/workshop/#download-and-install-minishift)
- [Start the OpenShift Server](https://github.com/IBM/minishift101/blob/master/workshop/#start-the-openshift-server)

The setup procedure should be run as a regular user with permission to launch virtual machines. In the procedure, you will see how to assign that permission, along with ways to configure your hypervisor and command shell to start and effectively interact with Minishift.

## Configure the virtualization environment

Minishift can be installed on Windows, Linux and Mac but depending on your platform, you will need to configure a compatible hypervisor in order for the OpenShift cluster to be created within the virtualised environment. Verify that the hypervisor of your choice is installed and enabled on your system before you set up Minishift. Once the hypervisor is up and running, additional setup is required for Minishift to work with that hypervisor.

See the appropriate section for your hypervisor and operating system:

- For Linux, [set up the KVM driver](https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/getting-started/setting-up-virtualization-environment.html#setting-up-kvm-driver)
- For macOS, [set up the hyperkit driver](https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/getting-started/setting-up-virtualization-environment.html#setting-up-hyperkit-driver)
- For Windows, [set up the Hyper-V driver](https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/getting-started/setting-up-virtualization-environment.html#setting-up-hyperkit-driver)
- For VirtualBox (all platforms), [set up Minishift to use VirtualBox](https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/getting-started/setting-up-virtualization-environment.html#setting-up-virtualbox-driver)

*NOTE:* If you have installed docker-ce for Mac on your machine, the hyperkit driver is already installed

## Download and install Minishift

To [download Minishift](https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/getting-started/installing.html), you can either install from source or if on Mac, you can install using Homebrew.

## Start the OpenShift Server

Providing you have completed the previous steps successfully, you will now be ready to start the OpenShift server. To do so, you should be able to run:

```bash
minishift start --vm-driver <driver>
```

Make sure to replace `<driver>` with the driver that you have used e.g. 'hyperkit' or 'virtualbox'. Once successfully started, you should be given the credentials to login to the cluster and the UI address as shown below:

```bash
OpenShift server started.

The server is accessible via web console at:
    https://192.168.64.11:8443/console

You are logged in as:
    User:     developer
    Password: <any value>

To login as administrator:
    oc login -u system:admin


-- Exporting of OpenShift images is occuring in background process with pid 5703.
```

*NOTE: Both your console address and your pid will be different.*

## Further cluster configurations

After setting up your cluster, you may have specific requirements that you want to enforce in your cluster. The minishift tool allows you to manage the lifecycle of the single-node OpenShift cluster as well as set environment variables, persistent storage and proxy options if your machine is behind a proxy. For more information on these configurations, see the following [link](https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/using/basic-usage.html#runtime-options).
