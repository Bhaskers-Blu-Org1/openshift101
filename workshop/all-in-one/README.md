# OpenShift 101 Lab

Welcome to our OpenShift 101 Lab

**So what is OpenShift?**

OpenShift is an open source container application platform based on the Kubernetes container orchestrator for enterprise application development and deployment. In this workshop we'll be using an OpenShift cluster on IBMâ€™s public cloud. OpenShift provides a way to empower developers to deploy code and not worry about the underlying ecosystem.

This workshop will show you a happy path to take advantage of most of the best parts of OpenShift and what it can offer. Specifically, this quick lab will cover the following:

* Getting started with Kubernetes
* Deploy a Node application with Source-to-Image
* Updating the application with a Webhook
* Logging, the terminal, and events
* Scaling the application

**Let's get started!**

---

# Exercise 0: Getting started with Kubernetes

A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run **containerized** applications. The worker node(s) host the Pods that are the components of the application workload. The control plane manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster.

## Checking access to a Kubernetes cluster

Check if the Kubernetes cluster is ready by running the command below to return the Kubernetes version.

```bash
kubectl version --short
```

{: codeblock}

## Deploying a microservices app on Kubernetes

The following command creates a [Kubernetes Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) called **my-app** from [`dewandemo/authors`](https://hub.docker.com/r/dewandemo/authors) image (which is on Docker Hub).

```bash
kubectl create deployment my-app --image=index.docker.io/dewandemo/authors:v1
```

{: codeblock}

Execute the following command to view the running pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

{: codeblock}

## Creating replicas

One of the powerful feature of Kubernetes is the ability to scale your deployment up or down. The following command scales up **my-app** deployment to three [repliacas](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/).

```bash
kubectl scale deployment my-app --replicas=3
```

{: codeblock}

Execute the following command to view the running pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

{: codeblock}

You should see a list like the snippet below:

```bash
my-app-cf48574d-6cssh      1/1     Running   0          10m
my-app-cf48574d-c97hr      1/1     Running   0          9m4s
my-app-cf48574d-pqssh      1/1     Running   0          9m4s
```

## Self-healing of Kubernetes

Delete one of the pods:

```bash
kubectl delete pods my-app-cf48574d-6cssh
```

After few moments, execute the following command and you should still see three running pods.

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

{: codeblock}

Kubernetes deleted one of the pods but the deployment ensures a replica of three at all times so another pod was spun up.

## Updating the deployment to a newer image version

```bash
kubectl set image deployment/my-app authors=index.docker.io/dewandemo/authors:v2
```

{: codeblock}

This is how easily you can update a deployment to use a newer (or older) image.

## Clean up

```bash
kubectl delete deployments my-app
```

{: codeblock}

## Understanding What Happened

We covered the following:

* Pods were created from a publicly accessible image on DockerHub.
* We showed that pods are automatically re-created.
* Builds are pushed to OpenShift's internal regitry.
* You can use `kubectl scale deployment` to create replicas.
* You can use `kubectl set image` to deploy a new image version.

Now let's see how OpenShift can make this easier!

# Exercise 1: Deploy a Node application with Source-to-Image

In this exercise, you'll deploy a simple Node.js Express application - "Example Health". Example Health is a simple UI for a patient health records system. We'll use this example to demonstrate key OpenShift features throughout this workshop. You can find the sample application GitHub repository here: [https://github.com/IBM/node-s2i-openshift](https://github.com/IBM/node-s2i-openshift)

## Deploy a new application

Access your cluster's web console by clicking the `OpenShift Console` button on the top-right.

![Launch Console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/snl-launch-console.png)

From the console's landing page, click on "+Add".

![Project Details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/snl-project-details.png)

From the "Add" page, choose to add a new item "From Catalog".

![Catalog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/developer-catalog.png)

Scroll down to the `Node.js` image. Click on that catalog button.

![NodeJS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/developer-nodejs.png)

Click `Create Application`.

You'll see an form like this:

![Create Source-to-Image Application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/nodejs-gitrepo.png)

Enter the repository: `https://github.com/IBM/node-s2i-openshift`.

Then click the `Show Advanced Git Options`. and `/site` for the 'Context Dir'. Click 'Create' at the bottom of the window to build and deploy the application.

![Context Dir](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/nodejs-context.png)

## Analyzing the build and deployment

Click on the center circle, you should see a build already in progress. You can click on the "View logs" to get more details.

![Build](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/nodejs-build.png)

When the build has deployed, find the "Routes." Click on that link:

![Successful Build](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/nodejs-success.png)

And you should see the login screen like the following:

![Login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/nodejs-login.png)

You can enter any strings for username and password, for instance `test:test` because the app is running in demo mode.

Congratulations! You've deployed a Node.js app to Kubernetes using OpenShift's Source-to-Image (S2I).

## Understanding What Happened

* [Source-to-Image](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/builds/build-strategies.html#build-strategy-s2i_build-strategies) (or S2I) is a framework that creates images from source code.
* The images are run as containers in pods.
* Creating a new application in OpenShift allows the user to specify multiple options for Building, Deploying, Scaling, Limits, and Routing.

# Exercise 2: Updating the application with a Webhook

So far we have been doing a lot of manual deployment. In a cloud-native world we want to move away from manual work and move toward automation. Wouldn't it be nice if our application rebuilt on git push events? Git webhooks are the way its done and openshift comes bundled in with git webhooks. Let's set it up for our project.

## Fork the code

To be able to setup git webhooks, we need to have elevated permission to the project. We don't own the repo we have been using so far. But since its opensource we can easily fork it and make it our own.

Fork the repo at [https://github.com/IBM/node-s2i-openshift](https://github.com/IBM/node-s2i-openshift)

![Fork](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/fork.png)

Now that I have forked the repo under my repo I have full admin privileges. As you can see I now have a settings button that I can change the repo settings with.

![Forked Repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/forked-repo.png)

We will come back to this page in a moment. Let's change our git source to our repo.

## Updating the build input

From our OpenShift dashboard for our project. Select `Builds`

![Build](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/nodejs-build-config.png)

Select the `node-s-2-i-openshift` build. As of now this should be the only build on screen.

![Select Build](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/nodejs-build-select.png)

Click on `Action` on the right and then select `Edit Build Config`

![Edit Build](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/nodejs-build-edit.png)

Change lines `21` and `42` to the new Git Repository URL of our forked repository, and click `Save`.

![Save Build Config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/nodejs-build-save.png)

You will see this will not result in a new build. If you want to start a manual build you can do so by clicking `Start Build`. We will skip this for now and move on to the webhook part.

## Configuring a webhook

Click on the main `Overview` tab.

Scroll down and click `Copy URL with Secret` of the `GitHub Webook URL`.

![Copy GitHub Webhook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/github-url-secret.png)

The webhook is in the structure

```text
https://c100-e.us-east.containers.cloud.ibm.com:31305/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/example-health/buildconfigs/patientui/webhooks/<secret>/github
```

In our forked GitHub repo go to `Setting` > `Webhooks`. Then click `Add Webhook`

![Webhook Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/webhook-page.png)

In the Add Webhook page fill provide it with the following options:

* `Payload URL`: The copied URL from earlier
* `Content type`: Set to `application/json`
* `Secret`: Can remain empty (this is the default)
* `Events`: Just the **Push** event is fine for our use (this is the default)

Click on `Add webhook`

![Add Webhook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/add-webhook.png)

> **NOTE**: If the webhook is reachable by GitHub you will see a green check mark.

Back in our OpenShift console we still would only see one build however. Because we added a webhook that sends us push events and we have no push event happening. Lets make one. The easiest way to do it is probably from the Github UI. Lets change some text in the login page.

Path to this file is `site/public/login.html` from the root of the directory. On Github you can edit any file by clicking the Pencil icon on the top right corner.

![Edit Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/edit-page.png)

Let's change the name our application to `Demo Health` (Line 21, Line 22). Feel free to make any other UI changes you feel like.

![Changes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/changes.png)

Once done go to the bottom and click `commit changes`.

Go to the OpenShift build page again. This happens quite fast so you might not see the running state. But the moment we made that commit a build was kicked off.

![Running Build](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/nodejs-rebuild-webhook.png)

In a moment it will show completed. Navigate to the main overview page to find the route.

![Routes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/nodejs-rebuild-overview.png)

> You could also go to `Applications > Routes` to find the route for the application.

If you go to your new route you will see your change.

![UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/nodejs-rebuild-updated.png)

# Exercise 3: Logs, terminal, and events

In this exercise, we'll explore the out-of-the-box logging and events capabilities that are offered in OpenShift.

## Simulate Load on the Application

First, let's simulate some load on our application. Run the following script which will endlessly spam our app with requests. Open a new terminal and enter the following:

```bash
while sleep 1; do curl -s <your_app_route>/info; done
```

> **NOTE**: Retrieve the external URL from the OpenShift console, or from the URL of your Example Health application. Note that there may be an `/index.html` at the end that you need to replace with `/info`. We're hitting the /info endpoint which will trigger some logs from our app. For example:

[`http://patientui-health-example.myopenshift-xxx.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud/info`](http://patientui-health-example.myopenshift-341665-66631af3eb2bd8030c5bb56d415b8851-0001.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud/jee.html)
{% endhint %}

## OpenShift Logging

Since we only created one pod, seeing our logs will be straight forward. Navigate to `View Logs` on the left on the main dashboard.

![Pods](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/view-logs.png)

You should be taken to something like the following. Scroll up and you should see the `DEBUG` like in the image. Scroll back down, and you should see a new line every second per the `curl` above.

![Logs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/view-logs-details.png)

## OpenShift Terminal

One of the great things about Kubernetes is the ability to quickly debug your application pods with SSH terminals. This is great for development, but generally is not recommended in production environments. OpenShift makes it even easier by allowing you to launch a terminal directly in the dashboard.

Switch to the `Terminal` tab, and run the following commands.

```bash
# This command shows you the the project files.
ls
```

```bash
# This command shows you the running processes.
ps aux
```

![Terminal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/terminal-output.png)

## OpenShift Events

When deploying new apps, making configuration changes, or simply inspecting the state of your cluster, OpenShift gives you an overview of your running assets.

You can also dive in a bit deeper - the `Events` tab is very useful for identifying the timeline of events and finding potential error messages.

![View Details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/event-details.png)

You'll want to refer to this view throughout the lab. Almost all actions we take in in OpenShift will result in an event being fired in this view. As it is updated real-time, it's a great way to track changes to state.

# Exercise 4: Scaling the application

In this exercise, we'll leverage the metrics we've observed in the previous step to automatically scale our UI application in response to load.

## Enable Resource Limits

Before we can setup autoscaling for our pods, we first need to set resource limits on the pods running in our cluster. Limits allows you to choose the minimum and maximum CPU and memory usage for a pod.

Hopefully you have your running script simulating load \(if not go [here](exercise-2.md#simulate-load-on-the-application)\), Our application is consuming anywhere between ".002" to ".02" cores. This translates to 2-20 "millicores".

That seems like a good range for our CPU request, but to be safe, let's bump the higher-end up to 30 millicores. In addition, the app consumes about `25`-`35` MB of RAM. Set the following resource limits for your deployment now.

Switch to the **Administrator** view and then navigate to **Workloads > Deployments** in the left-hand bar. Choose the `patient-ui` Deployment, then choose **Actions > Edit Deployment**.

![Deployments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/ocp-deployments.png)

In the YAML editor, go to line 44. In the section **template > spec > containers**, add the following resource limits into the empty resources. Replace the `resources {}`, and ensure the spacing is correct -- YAML uses strict indentation.

![Limits YAML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/ocp-limits-yaml.png)

  ```yaml
             resources:
               limits:
                 cpu: 30m
                 memory: 100Mi
               requests:
                 cpu: 3m
                 memory: 40Mi
  ```

**Save** and **Reload** to see the new version.

Verify that the replication controller has been changed by navigating to **Events**

![Resource Limits](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/ocp-dc-events.png)

## Enable Autoscaler

Now that we have resource limits, let's enable autoscaler.

By default, the autoscaler allows you to scale based on CPU or Memory. The UI allows you to do CPU only \(for now\). Pods are balanced between the minifmum and maximum number of pods that you specify. With the autoscaler, pods are automatically created or deleted to ensure that the average CPU usage of the pods is below the CPU request target as defined.
In general, you probably want to start scaling up when you get near `50`-`90`% of the CPU usage of a pod. In our case, let's make it `1`% to test the autoscaler since we are generating minimal load.

1. Navigate to **Workloads > Horizontal Pod Autoscalers**, then hit **Create Horizontal Pod Autoscaler**.

![HPA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/ocp-hpa.png)

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: patient-hpa
  namespace: example-health
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: patient-ui
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        targetAverageUtilization: 1
```

Hit **Create**.

## Test Autoscaler

If you're not running the script from the [previous exercise](exercise-2.md#simulate-load-on-the-application), the number of pods should stay at 1.

Check by going to the **Overview** page of **Deployments**.

![Scaled to 1 pod](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/ocp-hpa-before.png)

Start simulating load by hitting the page several times, or running the script. You'll see that it starts to scale up:

![Scaled to 4/10 pods](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/openshift101/skills-network/workshop/.gitbook/assets/ocp-hpa-after.png)

That's it! You now have a highly available and automatically scaled front-end Node.js application. OpenShift is automatically scaling your application pods since the CPU usage of the pods greatly exceeded `1`% of the resource limit, `30` millicores.

# Congratulations on deploying your first application on OpenShift

**Congratulations** on completing this lab, we hope you enjoyed it!

Here's a quick recap of what you did:

* Cloned a repository with sample code and a Dockerfile
* Built and pushed a new image to OpenShift's internal registry
* Deployed the application in a pod
* Exposed the app with a route

Before moving on to the next lab let's clean up our workspace by running these commands:

```bash
oc delete deployment node-s-2-i-openshift
oc delete svc node-s-2-i-openshift
oc delete bc node-s-2-i-openshift
oc delete route node-s-2-i-openshift
oc delete imagestream node-s-2-i-openshift
```
